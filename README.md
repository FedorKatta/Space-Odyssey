# Space-Odyssey
Space Odyssey is an adventure-based modpack which contains over 20 different worlds to explore! The modpack has its own unique quests system which will help players to make progress in mods and make the gameplay more interractive and fascinating. The purpose of the quest system is to help the beginners to find their way through the mekanisms and dismensions and to simplify the gameplay. Usually modpacks are based on grind, but Space Odyssey is completely opposite. Modpack includes over 90 mods which will add a lot of new features and improve the old ones. Also there are a plenty of optimization mods and thats why almost every PC can load it. You can also enjoy the gameplay with your friends because Space Odyssey has many features for multiplayer game. I wish you have fun playing the modpack!
IMPORTANT FEATURES:

YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MODS IN ADDITIONAL FILE!
I strongly recommend to download Optifine before playing!!!
Every file from the folder must be moved to the .minecraft folder, even if you think it is unnecessary!
When your game finishes loading it may get stuck on the last stage, but its ok so you shouldnt worry.
I recommend to play with 5-7 GB RAM, but 4 will also work.
The modpack has some custom crafts located in scripts folder.
You can turn the custom menu off by deleting the FancyMenu mod(if you have problems with optimization).
You can choose the button to open the quests page in settings->controls.
I strongly DONT recommend to use shaders, they may break the game.Â 
If you found a glitch or want to share your expirience (or want to download mods folder not using the curseforge) feel free to join our discord server: https://discord.gg/wZY7gdxTEs
The modpack also has a resoursepack which adds custom music.

The modpack was fully created by FedorKatta. Thanks for playing!
